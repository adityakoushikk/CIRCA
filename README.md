Abstract:




Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closed long non-coding RNAs with excellent prognostic and diagnostic biomarker properties for many diseases including cancer. By using liver tissues of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patient dataset, this study designed and tested a robust machine learning pipeline to predict circRNA targeted hub genes and their immunogenicity for immunotherapy for liver cancer. First, publicly available circRNA microarray datasets were analyzed in Python for the top twelve strongest deregulated circRNAs in tumor tissue compared to adjacent healthy tissue from HCC patients. Next, multiple classification models were trained and tested on the circRNA data and evaluated on multiple metrics. microRNA (miRNA) and gene targets (mRNA) of the deregulated circRNAs were predicted and top circRNA targeted hub genes were found from gene interaction network analysis in Cytoscape. Finally, an immunogenicity predictor in Python was built with a T-cell epitope prediction framework. This study found: 1) hsa_circ_0005284 is strongly positively correlated (upregulated) with tumor occurrence and hsa_circRNA_089372 is strongly downregulated in tumor occurrence, 2) the Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classification model can most accurately predict tumor occurrence based on circRNA data, 3) the RAB1A hub gene was predicted to be the most immunogenic hub gene in Python analysis. In conclusion, this project shows a possible therapeutic option involving direct targeting of hsa_circ_0005284 and hsa_circRNA_089372, and shows that the RAB1A gene peptides can be promising candidates for a liver cancer vaccine because of its high immunogenicity.
